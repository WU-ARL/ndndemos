Demo Setup requirements:
  install.sh contains most if not all of the install commands needed
    to get started from a freshly installed Ubuntu system. 

  CCNx (included in the install.sh above)
    git clone http://github.com/WU-ARL/ccnx

  ndnvideo (included in the install.sh above)
    git clone http://github.com/named-data/ndnvideo

  ndnvideo source needs to be edited to run in VM
    edit ndnvideo/videostreaming/utils.py
    change line 16 to be:
        video_sink = "ffmpegcolorspace ! videoscale ! ximagesink window-width=704 window-height=480"

  Firefox plugin (NOT included in the install.sh above)
    https://github.com/named-data/ndn-js/raw/downloads/ndnProtocol.xpi
    Save it to a file. Then go to Firefox: Tools: Add-ons
      On Add-ons page, click on Gear Icon and select Install Add-on From File.
      Add ndnProtocol.xpi
    From NDN menu bar: select set and enter 127.0.0.1



Demo commands reference:

  Chat:
   > ccnc -i 0 -l <name> ccnx:/ndn/broadcast/NAEchat


  Key verify
   > cd NAE_May_2013/verify_content
   > ./demo_verify.sh

  Firefox:
   URL=ndn:/ndn/wustl.edu/ndndemo/WUindex.html/
   That will give you a list of images from WU that you can download:
        Washington University in St. Louis Images:
        Graham Chapel (Large)
        Crow_Observatory (Large)
        Quad (Small)
        Brookings (Small) 
   Watch out for Firefox caching. Also, things sometimes get weird and it
     seems to lose its ability to load things. Not sure yet what is wrong.

  ndnvideo (used for both stored video playback with 1000 clients and for live video)
   > cd ndnvideo/videostreaming

   # For video from CAIDA/UCSD:
   > ./play.py /ndn/caida.org/apps/video

   # For video from UCLA:
   > ./play.py /ndn/ucla.edu/apps/video
