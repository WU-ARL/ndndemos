This directory contains the scripts used to run experiments on EC2 using
VLC and varnish proxies.

There are basically three phases:
   Start Instances
   Run Apps
   Process Data

The data that is process for this set of tests is tcpdump data that is collected
during the experiment. tcpdump is started by the run*.sh scripts which are 
in the InstanceFiles directory.

ec2Run.py: Connects to AWS EC2 to run the instances.
InstallScripts: Directory that contains the install scripts run by the EC2 instances at boot time.
                These scripts need to be copied to a place that we can use 'wget' from the instances
                to retrieve them. See README file in the InstallScripts directory.
InstanceFiles: Directory that contains the files specific to each type of instance.
                These files need to be copied to a place that we can use 'wget' from the instances
                to retrieve them. See README file in the InstanceFiles directory.
counts.sh: Sets the number of client and proxy instances to run.
start_clientsByRegion.sh: Starts just the client instances in their appropriate regions
start_proxiesByRegion.sh: Starts just the proxiy instances in their appropriate regions
start_server.sh: Starts the video server in its region (East, E1)
startAllInstances.sh: calls start_clientsByRegion.sh, start_proxiesByRegion.sh and start_server.sh to start
                      all instances.
runAllApps.sh : ssh's out to each instance to start the apps. After a period of time it then kills all the apps
                including the tcpdump's that were started for data collection.
process_tcpdump.sh: ssh's out to each instance to process the stored tcpdump data and produces a set of local
                    data files, one for each instance.

mkAwk.sh: writes an awk script to process the local instance data files produced by process_tcpdump.sh


Here are the commands that are typically run for an experiment:

./startAllInstances.sh 
./runAllApps.sh 
./process_tcpdump.sh
./mkAwk.sh > newAwk.sh 
./newAwk.sh  > Results
