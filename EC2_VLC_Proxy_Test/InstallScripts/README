The files in this directory are used as the install scripts on EC2 Instances.
The ec2Run.py script point to them via a URL and does a wget to retrieve
the appropriate one for the type of instance being run.

These scripts should be copied to a place where we can wget from and the 
ec2Run.py script should be updated to point to the corresponding URL.

These install scripts in turn use wget's to retrieve files that 
the corresponding type of instance needs to run the apps required.
The install scripts will need to be updated to point to the URL for
the location of the files in the directory InstanceFiles. There is
README file in that directory that describes them.
