NDN Demo given by Patrick Crowley and John DeHart at GEC-13, Wednesday March 14th in Los Angeles

Prelaunch:
    Open terminal window #1 on laptop and give it 6 tabs
       1. Laptop
       2. spphost6
       3. spphost6
       4. ebony
       5. ucla
       6. ebony

    Tab 2: Clear spphost6:~/.ssh/known_hosts

    Open terminal window #2 and start CCNX with UCLA as home gateway and start ccnchat
    Increase the font size by hitting Apple + about 6 times
      > cd ~/CCNX/conf
      > ./restartCCNX.ucla_direct_tcp.sh
      > ccnchat -text ccnx:/ndn/broadcast/GEC_chat

    Open terminal window #3 and start a second ccnchat for use with live chat
    Increase the font size by hitting Apple + about 6 times
      > ccnchat -text ccnx:/ndn/broadcast/GEC_live

    Open terminal window #4 to be used for ccn_fetch of file from WUSTL to LA
    Increase the font size by hitting Apple + about 6 times
      > cd /Users/johndehart/CCNX/ccnx-0.5.0/csrc/cmd

    Open terminal window #5 to be used with UCLA video streaming:
      > cd /Users/johndehart/CCNX/ndnvideo/videostreaming

    Start vlc

    All Instances: Do this a couple of hours before the Demo to give them all plenty
               of time to get going.

      Launch the apps instances. Except for the repositories, there is a separation 
          between launching the EC2 instances and starting the apps. There is a 
          shell script placed in ~ubuntu/startApp.sh on each instance which will 
          start the app which that instance is set up for.
          Repositories, start up when launched. They take a long time to load all
          the files into the CCNX Repository.

          This is all done now through:
           > cd /project/arl/NDN/jdd/ndnec2
           > ./startAllInstances.sh

              Tab 3 (spphost6): On spphost6.arl.wustl.edu
                  > cd /project/arl/NDN/jdd/ndnec2
                  > ./startReposByRegion.sh
                  > ./startChatClientsByRegion.sh 25
                  > ./startChatServersByRegion.sh
                  > ./startVlcByRegion.sh 1
        


          Start the Chat Client Apps:
          MAKE SURE YOU HAVE STARTED THE ccnchat on laptop for GEC_chat FIRST!
          AND DO WE NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO eventual network connection first?
          > ./startAppsChatClientsByRegion.sh

      Tab 3 (spphost6): Set up routes on the gateways that have Repositories hanging off them:
         -- load public key on gateway machines so we can ssh in to run a command
         After Repositories are started, on spphost6:
          > ./setGatewayRoutes.sh

    Tab 1: Start Map: About 30 - 60 minutes before demo (takes 5-6 minutes to start)
      > cd /Users/johndehart/NDN/ndnmap
      > ./startMap.sh
     
      At the end of the deploy it will tell you the URL for the web server.

    Open Firefox
    Set up Map on web page. Stretch web browser across entire screen with room for
      chat windows under it.

    Tab 2 (spphost6): Set up an ssh tunnel on spphost6.arl.wustl.edu to allow SPPs
            to report link data to the web server
        Take the machine name part of the web server URL report at the end 
            of the deploy command and use it on spphost6.arl.wustl.edu as follows:

        spphost6> ssh -L128.252.153.26:8080:ec2 full host name:80 jdd@localhost

    Set up Windows for chats and fetch: About 30-60 minutes before demo

    Tab 4 (ebony): Set up the routes on the SPPs (they should be there but just to be safe)
      > cd ~/NDN
      > ./setupGECSPPRoutes.sh  udp

    Tab 4 (ebony): Start the reporting of link data from SPPs:
        1. Open a window to ebony (may have to go through ssh.seas.wustl.edu to get 
           to ebony from outside WU)
        2. run ssh-agent -s and cut and paste the "SSH_AUTH_SOCK..." line
        3. run ssh-add ~/.ssh/all_planetlab_id_rsa
        4. run /users/jdd/NDN/startSendLinkData.sh
        5. You can check that they are running by running 
               > /users/jdd/NDN/checkSendLinkData.sh
        6. To kill them run /users/jdd/NDN/killSendLinkData.sh

        These scripts MUST be run from ebony. Other machines do not have 
        access to the backdoor interface on the SPPs.

    Tab 5 (ucla): Start the reporting of link data from UCLA
        > cd WashU
        > ./startSendLinkData.sh
             That runs: 1. /home/ccnx/WashU/sendLinkDataUCLA.sh -u 128.252.153.26:8080 -i 1 &

    Tab 6 (ebony): 
        For use during the bulk file transfer
        > cd ~/NDN
        To make sure they are up BEFORE starting demo, do this:
        > ./routeToWASHUviaKANS_HOUS.sh up
        > ./routeToWASHUviaKANS_SALT.sh up



PHASE1: Live chat
    In window #3 for use with live chat
    Chat with Jyoti

PHASE2: Video with VLC
      In Tab 3 (spphost6): On spphost6.arl.wustl.edu
          > ./startAppsVlcByRegion.sh ccnx:///GEC/ndn/colostate.edu/GECREPO/NASA009.mpg

      To stop:
         > ./stopAppsVlcByRegion.sh          

PHASE3: Robochat
      In terminal window #2 
         Scroll through all the "has entered" messages to show large number of participants
      In Tab 3 (spphost6): On spphost6.arl.wustl.edu
          > ./startAppsChatServersByRegion.sh

      To stop:
          > ./stopAppsChatServersByRegion.sh

PHASE4: File Transfer
    In window #4 for ccn_fetch of file from WUSTL to LA
      > ./ccn_fetch -mb 24 -out fetch.mpg ccnx:/GEC/ndn/wustl.edu/GECREPO/NASA009.mpg

    Tab 6 (ebony): 
        To take the route to WASHU via KANS down on SALT:
        > ./routeToWASHUviaKANS_SALT.sh down

        To take the route to WASHU via KANS down on HOUS:
        > ./routeToWASHUviaKANS_HOUS.sh down

        Bring them back up:
        > ./routeToWASHUviaKANS_HOUS.sh up
        > ./routeToWASHUviaKANS_SALT.sh up

    In window #4 if fetch has not finished, Ctr-C it so it doesn't interfere.

PHASE5: UCLA Video streaming
    In window #5 command to get the video will be something like one of these:
          > ./play.py /ndn/ucla.edu/apps/hydra/09/mainvideo 
          > ./play.py /ndn/ucla.edu/apps/hydra/%FD%04%F5%99%DAid/mainvideo


CAUTION: If any node gets rebooted or its link goes away, the routes
   on the other end (gateway on the other end of that link) will go
   away.

Start the apps
Tab 3 (spphost6): 
    Still need to figure out what to do with the output from the apps.
    For instance, for the chat we should redirect it somewhere but we
        also have to keep the ssh from stalling.

    The repositories start themselves. They take a long time to load all the files.

    There is one start script for each kind of app:
        startChatApps.sh  
        startChatServerApps.sh  
        startVLCApps.sh

On spphost6.arl.wustl.edu
# EAST 01 REGION
> cd /project/arl/NDN/jdd
> source ./.ec2_access_east_1
> cd ndnec2
> ./ec2Run.py -l -r "us-east-1"
This will list the hostnames and apps for this region. For each app launch the app with this:
> ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -i ~/.ssh/AmazonEC2_JDD_east_1.pem ubuntu@<hostname> /home/ubuntu/startApp.sh

# WEST 01 REGION
> cd /project/arl/NDN/jdd
> source ./.ec2_access_west_1
> cd ndnec2
> ./ec2Run.py -l -r "us-west-1"
This will list the hostnames and apps for this region. For each app launch the app with this:
> ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -i ~/.ssh/AmazonEC2_JDD_west_1.pem ubuntu@<hostname> /home/ubuntu/startApp.sh

# WEST 02 REGION
> cd /project/arl/NDN/jdd
> source ./.ec2_access_west_2
> cd ndnec2
> ./ec2Run.py -l -r "us-west-2"
This will list the hostnames and apps for this region. For each app launch the app with this:
> ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -i ~/.ssh/AmazonEC2_JDD_west_2.pem ubuntu@<hostname> /home/ubuntu/startApp.sh


DEBUG:
To run the map locally:
> cd /Users/johndehart/NDN/ndnmap
> python manage.py runserver

Then go to a web browser and load URL  localhost:8000
